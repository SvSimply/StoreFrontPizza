# Store Front Reflection

## Instructions

1. *Create a new folder within this current folder, and name the new folder
   after your team name*
2. *If you prefer keeping this reflection private to your team, you may change
   the permissions on your folder so that only your teammates + unit instructors
   can view the contents*
3. *Create a copy of this reflection template, and put it in your newly created
   folder *

*Please answer at least one question from each section below. Answers here will
likely be inspiration for the “lessons learned” section of your project
presentation at the end of the unit.*

## Design

* Q. How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway?
* A. Our group closely followed our design document. However, a few small deviations were made. For instance, we decided on a single primary key schema for our tables. 

## Project

* Q. How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
* A. During planning our group was thorough when defining which features were in the minimum scope, which were possible additions, and which were out of scope. This enabled us to implement one feature at a time. This approach helped to decrease the ambiguity of the project.
* Q. How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?
* A. We as a group employed a few strategies to deal with roadblocks in this project. Dividing challenged into more manageable pieces was effective. As well as using external resources to study. We were sure to reach out to each other for help or to  bounce ideas, which was very effective.


## Scrum


* Q. Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?
* A. We definitely overestimated our workload. We have learned that when working with new tools and concepts you must anticipate getting stuck. This will allow you to create more realistic deadlines.

## Looking ahead

* Q. If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?
* A. We all agree that planning the specifics of coding, such as pseudo code, as well as layouts would make this project more manageable.
