# Store Front Design Document





## Store Front Design

## 1. Problem Statement

Our team is creating the online presence of Jimbo's Pizzeria, a local restaurant.
With the increased popularity of ordering food via the app, the restaurant has decided to create its own online storefront.
This design document describes the online services available to the customer.
The service is designed to receive a fo~~od order from the customer, return an order confirmation, allow special requests to be added to the order, and provide the order's status to the customer.



## 2. Top Questions to Resolve in Review

How to get order status to the customer?

How to get the front and back end to communicate with each other?

How many database tables are needed?

Update menu functionality?


## 3. Use Cases

u1: I as a customer am hungry and would like to order food online.

u2: I as a customer want to view the status of my order.

u3: I as a customer would like to view previous orders.

u4: I as a customer would like to update my order.

u5: I as an owner would like to see the list of active orders.

u6: I as an owner would like to change order's status.

u7: I as an owner would like to see actual restaurant's stock.

# 5. Proposed Architecture Overview

**Webpages with all features:**

* check the order’s status input field on the start page instead of a separate page.

**Client front-end part:**

* Menu list with the ability to select items and enter counts. Button “Next”.
* A custom pizza page with ingredients to choose from.
* A checkout page with places to enter customer data and the button “Order”.
* Shows the total sum.
* Additional feature: show selected items.
* Additional feature: change order.
* Order succeeded page with a happy phrase, a new order id, total, and a list of ordered items (?).
* Use the Order status result page to show status immediately after the order is placed.
* If an error occurs then an unhappy phrase.
* Check the order’s status page with two input fields (order id or phone number).
* Order status result page with the order’s status with update time.

**Business facing front-end:**

* List of active orders page with a button to mark order done.
* Additional feature: show all orders sorted by status.

### **Flow Chart** 
![The client visits the playlist page of the Website Playlist. The Website
playlist page sends a get song request to the GetPlaylistSongsActivity. The
GetPlaylistSongsActivity calls the playlists database to load the playlist. The
playlists database returns the playlist item to the GetPlaylistSongsActivity.
The GetPlaylistSongsActivity returns a List<SongModel> to the Website Playlist
page. The Website playlist page presents a list of songs to the
client.](images/FlowChart.png)
